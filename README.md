# Boolean Convert

Your stub code sets up a function called `boolean_convert`. Your job is to write code that will accept a string as a parameter and return the string "Yes" if the input is the boolean value true and the string "No" if the input is the boolean value false. For any other value, return "Input must be a boolean value - true or false"

## Hints
- DO NOT CHANGE THE FUNCTION NAME! For the tests to work, it needs to retain the current name
- This will only test the functionality of the `boolean_convert` function in the javascript file. You can add whatever code you need elsewhere to ensure you are doing the right thing.
- This will be testing the data COMING OUT of the function, NOT data displayed on the screen.
- ignore the other files in this repo. The only file you need to modify is the `boolean_convert.js`"
