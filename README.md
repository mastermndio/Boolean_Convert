# Phone Number

Your stub code sets up a function called `phone_number`. Your job is to write code that will accept a string as a parameter and return a true value if the input has the correct number of digits(characters) and a false value for any other scenario

## Hints
- DO NOT CHANGE THE FUNCTION NAME! For the tests to work, it needs to retain the current name
- This will only test the functionality of the `phone_number` function in the javascript file. You can add whatever code you need elsewhere to ensure you are doing the right thing.
- This will be testing the data COMING OUT of the function, NOT data displayed on the screen.
- ignore the other files in this repo. The only file you need to modify is the `phone_number.js`"

## Instructions
1. Clone this repo
```bash
git clone 
```

2. Enter Hello-World repo
```bash
cd Phone-Number
```

3. Run an NPM install to enable the automatic tests
``` bash
npm install
```

4. Run npm test to execute tests when you think you have solved the issue and are redy to test.

```bash
npm run test
```

5. Commit your answers and push code.
